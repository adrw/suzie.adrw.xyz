Soups get a traditional soup spoon and sometimes a regular spoon too if served with rice. Grilled meats are eaten off the skewers. And when we're not sure, we can take a note from the locals. </p>\n<p>Street meat. A delicious option any time of day, especially for breakfast. These smoky skewers kept my taste buds longing for more! Just enough crisp and moisture from a low and slow grill. Each vendor has different options (chicken, pork, sausage, ? balls, pork belly) so we just had to find the one we wanted.\nFood cart in Sathon district, Bangkok.</p>\n<p>Mystery soup. Found at a busy street cart -popular among the motor taxi drivers, we had to try this place. A flavourful light broth with chicken, pork, blood cubes, small intestine and some chewy meat, little greens and chives served with a side of rice. Accompanied with a typical tray for custom seasoning including dry red chilli, light brown sugar, vinegar with chili, soy sauce.\nStreet cart in Sathon district, Bangkok.</p>\n<p>Green Thai curry.
