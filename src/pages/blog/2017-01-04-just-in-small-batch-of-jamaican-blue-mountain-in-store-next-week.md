You'd think packing a small bag would be easy but guess again! Sometimes it takes a few tries. 

## hurried packing 

Without the advantage of time to think through each item, you're bound to fall into a common misconception.

> What if I need... \[Insert random smelly lotion, clothing, etc]

Give yourself time to pack and repack, carefully considering what items you'll _really_ need.

## you can't take all your shoes 

Need I say more? You want to take a pair of shoes for every occasion that could occur... But you don't really need then all!

## versatile clothes are your friend 

I decided to pack a tshirt and tank top that could double as pj's and day outfits when paired with shorts! That being said, some may say you don't need pj's but to each their own ;)

## a second set of eyes (or bag)

If you can, share your logic with someone else -they can be helpful in deciding what to take.

If you're travelling in as a couple or group, decide how to split common items like first aid kits and sunscreen -you don't each need your own!

## have fun 

Take this as a fun challenge of how light you can pack
