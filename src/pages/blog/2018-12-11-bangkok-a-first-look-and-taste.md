Day 1. 18,749 steps and 11.2 km
Andrew and I decided to walk so we could get a detailed look at Bangkok. Here's what we saw and tasted.

We have one more day in Bangkok so I'll update this post if we eat or see anything interest. 

## the neighbourhood

We started off the morning walking a few blocks to get familiar with the neighbourhood of Sathon we were staying in. 
We saw kids headed to school in their uniforms, car shops custom cutting car parts, construction material shops, street food vendors of all kinds, lottery ticket sellers and people moving around getting to where they were headed. 

## breakfast 
The walk around the block gave us a sense of the types of foods being sold. 

We smelled some delicious grilled meat and wandered over. Welcome to the city where you can eating freshly grilled meat skewers for breakfast. Let's make this a thing in Canada, please! 

A bit more wandering and we found a cart selling soup. It was a popular place with the locals especially the motorbike taxi workers. After a little bit of a struggle ordering, I basically ordered whatever everyone else what having. It's important to know most street food vendors cook up one or two types of dishes so you get what they're going (with a bit of customization if it's a dish with mixed ingredients). So we were seated at a foldable metal table with stools as chairs. Now we just wait for our soup to cook! The soup was the first traditional dish we had here containing a flavourful light broth with chicken, pork, blood cubes, small intestine and some chewy meat, little greens and chives served with a side of rice. I was a bit nervous about the unfamiliar bits but boy was it delicious.

## the hussle and bustle
The traffic here was the first thing that really stood out. How the cars, buses and motorbikes zip around effortlessly as pedestrians cross between without stopping traffic! After watching the locals do this a few times and remembering that traffic drives on the left side (not he right lane like they do in Canada), we managed to cross the road like pros! 
But let's get back to the motorbikes. I still have this image ingrained in my mind of seeing a dad with baby held in front of him as he waved through traffic. Or a mom with daughter balanced on the back on her phone. I'm in awe while realizing that's part of everyday life here.

## errands and 7-11
Getting cash in Bangkok is really easy -we went to a bank atm but noticed there were also tons of tourist atms in it streets. 
Now for everything else there's 7-11. This place has everything you could need -hygiene products, baby supplies, food, and (as our friends told us over lunch) even plane tickets!

## a local guide 
We did quite a bit of research before this trip but were lucky to also get connected with a local couple. They are Canadians who have been living in Bangkok for the past few years. They gave us lots of great recommendations and tips for getting around over lunch while sharing about their life here. And yes, lunch (green curry for me and a coconut/ginger-y soup with fried rice for Andrew along with butterfly pea drinks and dessert) was delicious too! Butterfly pea is tasty and quite famous in Asia. I haven't quite found a way to describe the flavour but will update once I do. :)

## something for everyone 
Bangkok has everything from cheap to high-end food, massages, shopping malls/markets and hotels -there's bound to be something for everyone. 

## bubble tea, an impromptu haircut and the park
I had a freshly made taro milk tea for 25 bhat ($1 CAD) during our afternoon walk. It was so good and had lots of flavour options.

A few blocks later, we walked by a series of barber shops and one was free so Andrew hopped in the chair to get a haircut.

With the help of a photo on his phone, Andrew told the barber what he wanted. Then we were off again feeling fresh and fine as ever!

## a long day gets a bit longer when cabbing
After a long day, we decided to take a cab back. Normally we would use Grab (the uber of South East Asia) but decided to give hailing a cab a try! How hard could it be? But you know that everyone has a cab story in Bangkok. We hailed one down and got in before someone could snag it (which does happen!). We showed the driver a google map with our address but this did not work out. If you ever take a cab, take your hotel's business card with you because that has the address writen in Thai and always make sure they use the meter. Long story short, things ended up okay as the driver pulling off to let us out after a few attempts at explaining the address and we ordered a car through the trusty Grab app. 

## lamppini park 
Bangkok's version of Central Park with exercise machines, an outdoor gym, large running path, benches and a playground for the kids. The jogging culture is huge here! I chuckled to myself when I saw ladies jogging with makeup but your also talking to someone who doesn't really do formal exercise or makeup so maybe this is normal?

## asiatique
A boutique open air market with fashionable buys and a variety of restaurants, food trucks and stalls on the beautiful riverfront. This place has quite the aesthetic and is enjoyed by many tourists. We ordered a car to get here and enjoyed some fried wings along the waterfront watching boats go by. A good end to the day.
